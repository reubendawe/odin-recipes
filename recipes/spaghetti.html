    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This million dollar spaghetti dish features a beefy, creamy tomato sauce that’s impossible to resist. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Beef</strong>: You’ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and ground turkey, if you prefer.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti Sauce</strong>: Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream</strong>: A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti.</li>
    </ul>
