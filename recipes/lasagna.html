    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Tomato Products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <br>

        <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <br>
